\section{Showcase for the Dark QCD model}
\label{darksec}

The arguments discussed before can be illustrated using a concrete physics scenario.
In particular, we will consider the dark QCD model \cite{Bai:2013xga,Schwaller:2015gea} which predicts 
``emerging'' jets 
that are created in the decays of new long-lived neutral 
particles (dark hadrons), produced in a parton-shower process by dark QCD.
The final-state signature consists of four high transverse momentum jets, two of which 
are from two from dark quarks. These two ``emerging'' jets contain many displaced
vertices arising from the decays of the dark pions produced in the dark parton shower.
Recently searches for such emerging jets have been performed \cite{Sirunyan:2018njd} 
by the CMS Collaboration.

We will be interested in the efficiency of the reconstruction of dark mesons  as a function of their mass
and the lifetime.    
The $pp$ collision event samples  are generated with the ``hidden valley'' model framework in PYTHIA 8.2 assuming
the HE-LHC center of mass energy of 27~TeV. The Monte Carlo settings for the signal model were similar
to those discussed in  \cite{Sirunyan:2018njd}, but then were further tuned \cite{prive} to obtain samples  which were most suitable
for the detector performance studies. 
The mass of the mediator was set to 10~TeV, while the mass of the dark pion was varied in the range between 5 and 1000 GeV.
The dark pion proper decay length, $c\tau$,  was varied between 1 and 1000~mm (independent of its mass). Other parameters
were also appropriately modified to allow a sufficient phase space for the dark meson production.
The mass of the dark pion is assumed to be one half the mass of the dark quark. The mass of the dark
$\rho$  meson was also modified, and is taken to be larger by 10~GeV than the mass of the dark pion. The width of the
mediator particle is assumed to be small as compared with the detector mass resolution.

Dark pion decay length defines the distance from the interaction point where a jet emerges. The  emerging jet contains multiple displaced vertices,
which con be reconstructed using a tracker  \cite{Sirunyan:2018njd}. 
Such jets can also be reconstructed using the calorimeter  with the timing layers. This method is expected
to have advantage when the dark pion decay length is significant and the tracker cannot be efficient in reconstructing such tracks. 
It was also pointed out \cite{Schwaller:2015gea} that the emerging jets may have significant fraction of neutral particles and the reconstruction
using charged tracks can have a low efficiency.  

To estimate the performance of the timing layers in reconstructing emerging jets, 
we will use the formalism based on Eq.~\ref{eqTOF}, where $L=c\tau$, and $m$ is the mass
of the dark photon, i.e. $L$ can be considered as a travel distance. After the dark pion creates a Standard Model jet, we assume that
such jets travel to the surface of the timing layer with the same speed for all values of $m$.
For the timing layers, the signature of emerging jets is time delays compared to the other (Standard Model) jets. The  production vertex
cannot be observed by the timing layers if such jets emerges before TL1\footnote{It is possible that if such jets is created in the area between TL1 and TL2,
such signatures can also be detected, but we will not consider this case.}
After events being generated, the weighted average of decay distances of all particles that originate from
the dark mesons, using the particle momentum as the weight, was calculated. This decay distance is used 
to approximate the decay length, without using jet reconstruction.  Then the decay length (expressed in meters),  
momentum and the mass of the dark meson were used as the input for Eq.~\ref{eqTOF}.
The  calculation for the $3\sigma$ separation will be performed using $m_F=m_{\alpha}\simeq 3.73$~GeV although such a choice can be rather arbitrary.
This value of $m_F$ is used to give a conservative estimate of the arrival time of the Standard Model jets. 
(One can argue that the Standard Model jets mainly consist of light-flavour hadrons and photons, therefore, $m_F$ is significantly lower). 

The efficiency of reconstruction of the emerging jets by measuring the timing information was calculated by counting the number of events that pass the 
Eq.~\ref{eqTOF} conditions  with the parameters as discussed before, divided by the total number of entries
without this requirement. Figure~\ref{fig:efficiency} shows the efficiency
as a function of the $c\tau$ and the mass of the dark pion. It can be seen that a detector with the standard 1~ns resolution does
not have acceptance for the dark meson measurements. The acceptance is significantly larger for the timing layers smaller than 100~ns.
The acceptance is small for low $c\tau$ or small masses, which is the expected feature of the timing measurement.
The timing layers with 20~ns have almots 100\% efficiency for large values of $c\tau$ and dark-meson masses.
