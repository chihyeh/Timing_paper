\section{Introduction}

Future experiments, such as CLIC \cite{Linssen:1425915}, International Linear Collider (ILC) \cite{Behnke:2013xla}, high-energy LHC (HE-LHC),
future circular $pp$ colliders of the European initiative, FCC-hh~\cite{Benedikt:2206376} and the Chinese initiative, SppC~\cite{Tang:2015qga} 
will require high precision measurements of particles and jets 
at large transverse momenta. 
The usage of timing information for such experiments  can  provide additional 
information that can be used to improve particle and jet reconstruction, as well as to reduce background events.
For example, high-precision timing will be beneficial for b-tagging for all post-LHC experiments. 
For CLIC and FCC, high-precision time stamping of calorimeter energy deposits will be essential for
background rejection (i.e. fake energy deposits) and pile-up mitigation.
Precise timing information is important for improving reconstruction of particle flow objects by reducing overlap 
of energy showers in highly-granular calorimeters.

From the physics point of view, timing layers can be used for detection of long-lived particles and identification 
of standard model (SM) particles. 
At this moment, conceptional design reports for future experiments have not yet fully explored 
the benefits of the time of flight (TOF) measurements with tens-of-picosecond resolutions for calorimeters.

In this paper we will investigate the benefits of the timing layers with the resolution in the range
10~ps -- 1~ns for identification of SM particles. 
The resolution of 1~ns is standard for the existing and planned calorimeters \cite{Linssen:1425915,Behnke:2013xla,Benedikt:2206376,Tang:2015qga}, 
and is only used as a benchmark for comparisons with more challenging  
10 -- 20~ps  resolution devices. 
In addition, we investigate the capabilities of timing layers for identification of heavy stable particles which may be produced beyond the 
standard model (BSM). We hope such studies can help shape the requirements for future calorimeters, which were already
outlined in the CPAD report \cite{Ahmed:2019sim} that emphasized the need to develop fast timing readout for calorimeter measurements.

\section{Proposal}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


A generic design of hadronic (electromagnetic) calorimeters for future particle collision experiments (HE-LHC, FCC, CLIC, ILC etc.) 
is based on two main characteristics: (1) high-granularity  electromagnetic (ECAL) and hadronic (HCAL) 
calorimeters with cells ranged from $3\times 3$~mm$^2$ to $5\times 5$~cm$^2$.
(2) timing with a nanosecond precision that improves background rejection, vertex association, and detection of new particles. 
According to the CPAD report \cite{Ahmed:2019sim}, a development of ``picosecond time resolution'' for future calorimeters is one of the critical needs. 
Presently,  high-granularity calorimeters with $>1$ millions channels and with tens of pico-second resolution represent a 
significant challenge due to the large cost.

As a part of the HL-LHC upgrade program, CMS and ATLAS experiments are designing high-precision timing detectors with the time resolution of about 30~ps \cite{Collaboration:2623663,FERRI2020162159}. They are based on silicon sensors that add an extra ``dimension’’ to event reconstruction. 

As discussed above, such timing capabilities have not been fully explored for future detectors beyond the HL-LHC upgrade. 
In particular, the baseline designs of the ECAL and HCAL of the CLIC/FCC detectors have not been 
optimized for precision timing in the range of a few tens of picoseconds. 
The latter is considered as an expensive option for many millions of the channels of these highly granular detectors. 
This opens an opportunity to investigate a cost-effective ``timing layer'' (with the time resolution of smaller than 30~ps) for the post-LHC detectors. 
This layer will be installed in front of high-granularity calorimeters, covering both the forward and barrel regions.

In this paper we  will investigate the physics advantages of installing timing layers in the front of calorimeters  
of the post-LHC experiments. 
Typically, thin detectors in front of calorimeters are called ``preshower'', and they have been previously installed for the ZEUS, CDF, ATLAS and CMS experiments.
The design goal of such detectors is to count the number of charged
particles in order to correct for energy losses. The timing information of ``MIP'' (minimum ionizing particles) is 
not used for particle identifications, nor precise timing. 
Unlike the standard preshower detectors, we propose to not only count MIP signals, but also reconstruct high-precision timing and the position of the MIPs.
This timing detector will have a similar granularity as the proposed high-granularity electromagnetic calorimeters, 
but will have the sensor technology and the readout that are best suited for time stamping of MIP signals.
Our proposal is to enclose the EM detectors with two timing layers, one - before the first EM layer, and the other - after the 
last ECAL layer (but before
the HCAL first layer). The two timing detectors allow a robust identification of time stamps by correlating the position and time of the particles passing through
the ECAL.

In this paper we will explore this idea using a semi-analytical approach and Monte Carlo simulations. 
A schematic representation of the positions of the timing layers for a generic detector geometry is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:eff_rad}. 
In the following, the first timing layer (closest to the interaction point) will be called TL1, while the second timing layer after the electromagnetic calorimeter will be called TL2.

\caption{An example of positions of the thin timing layers for a generic detector. The timing detectors  enclose the 
electromagnetic calorimeter, allowing 
a reliable reconstruction of the  MIP signals with a timing resolution of the order of 10~ps.}
\label{fig:eff_rad}
\end{figure}


There are several reasons why the second timing layer (TL2) can be useful:

\begin{itemize}

\item
It can be used to measure the TOF between TL2 and TL1 for identification
of stable massive particles without known production vertex. This is especially important
for the BSM models predicting stable heavy particles
decaying close to the surface of the electromagnetic calorimeter, or
in the situations when tracks cannot be used to establish the production origin for neutral heavy particles.
For proton colliders,  the second layer can mitigate situations when the primary vertex position  
is smeared due to large pileup.


For a typical ECAL based on the silicon technology, the distance between TL2 and TL1 is  0.2 -- 0.4~m (depending on the calorimeter design).
It is not immediately obvious that such a small distance can be used for physics measurements. 
A particle traveling with the speed of light can cross the distance between TL1 and TL1 within $\sim 1$~ns.
As we will discuss later, this distance is sufficient to provide a large acceptance 
for heavy particle identification  assuming a 10 -- 20~ps detectors. 

\item
It allows to correlate the hits with the first layer, and thus provides directionality of the hits. This feature can be useful to
match the hits with the calorimeter cells and to deal with back-scatter 
hits which are typically arriving from the hadronic calorimeter at later time. 

\item
It provides the redundancy for the calculation of TOF using the distance from the interaction point which can be determined using tracks.

\end{itemize}


The second layer of the timing detector can be justified if the recorded time difference between
the first and the last ECAL  
layers of the electromagnetic showers is not significantly different from that expected from a particle traveling with the speed of light.
If the travel time is significantly affected by large fluctuations caused by electromagnetic showers,    
second timing layer cannot effectively be used.

In order to verify this point, we used a full Geant4 (version 10.3)~\cite{Allison2016186} simulation 
of the SiFCC detector \cite{Chekanov:2016ppq} that allows to use the information of the ECAL hits.
This detector design has an ECAL built from a highly segmented silicon-tungsten cells with the transverse size of $2 \times 2$~cm.
The ECAL has 30 layers of tungsten pads with silicon readout,
corresponding to 35~X$_{0}$. The first 20 layers use tungsten of 3~mm thickness.
The last ten layers use tungsten layers of
twice the thickness, and thus have half the  sampling fraction.  
The distance between the centers of the last and first ECAL layer is about 240~mm.  

To verify that the time differences between the last and the first ECAL layer is close to the time
required for a particle that travels with the speed of light, and can be neglected for the timing layers that
have a timing resolution of the order of 1~ns, a sample of single pions ($\pi^\pm$) was created with 1 and 10~GeV momentum, respectively. The
pseudorapidity for all pions was $\eta=0$ (central region). 
The particles were reconstructed in the ECAL calorimeter,
and the time difference $\Delta T= T_{\mathrm{last}}-T_{\mathrm{first}}$ of the hits between the last and first ECAL layers was calculated.
Only the hits arriving first in time were considered since the electronics typically register\footnote{The Monte Carlo studies used in this paper does not include
simulations of calorimeter electronics.} the fastest hits (while slower hits can be saved in pipeline buffers).

Figure~\ref{fig:timediff} shows the time distribution of first arriving hits 
for 1 and 10 GeV pions. It can be seen that the peak positions of the distributions are smaller
than 1~ns, as expected for the distance of about 20~cm between  the centers of the last and first ECAL layers.
Therefore, the hits registered by TL1 and TL2 will be simultaneous for the
standard 1~ns resolution readout. They will be fully correlated in time, and are identified as a single crossing particle.

If a resolution of the timing layer is of the order of 10 -- 20~ps, a physics measurement of TOF would be possible.
To check this, 
Figure~\ref{fig:timediff} shows the hit distribution for (anti)deuterons, denoted as $d^{\pm}$. 
The distributions are significantly different from the $\pi^{\pm}$ case. According to the simulation, the 1~GeV
(anti)deuterons should be measured on average with the time delay of 0.7 -- 1.4~ns between the last and first layers.
The value of 0.7~ns was estimated from the mean position of the Landau distribution used to fit the $d^{\pm}$ 
curve presented in Figure~\ref{fig:timediff}(a),
while 1.4~ns was obtained from the mean of this distribution. Even for the most conservative 0.7~ns value, there is an indication that 1~GeV
deuterons can be separated from pions that have 0.5~ns time difference. Such a separation can be observed when using a tens-of-picosecond detector.
For the 10~GeV particles presented in Figure~\ref{fig:timediff}(b), no separation between $d^{\pm}$ and $\pi^{\pm}$ can be observed.

In summary, we have illustrated that a typical difference between TL2 and TL1 (which is approximated by the difference
between the last and first ECAL layer) is sufficient for particle identification using the TOF.
As an example, a $d^{\pm}$ can be identified and separated from pions for the momentum less than 1~GeV.
This means that  particles heavier than deuterons should be identified for a momentum larger than 1~GeV.
In the following, we will abstract from the Geant4 simulations and calculate the kinematic regions  where the identification of heavy stable 
particles using timing layers is possible.

\section{Summary}

This paper discusses the benefits of the timing layers positioned in front of the hadronic calorimeters.
Using the full Geant4 simulations and a semi-analytic approach,
the figures of merits for identification of single particles
using timing layers with resolutions of 10~ps -- 1~ns were calculated.
It was illustrated 
how such layers can be used for single particle identification and
identification of heavy long-lived particles in the context of the dark QCD model.
It was shown that the timing layers lead to a significant benefit for reconstruction of heavy long-lived particles 
in the region of $c\tau$ and momentum where track measurements have low reconstruction acceptance.
